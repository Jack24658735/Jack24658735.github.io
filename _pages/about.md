I am a graduate student pursuing my M.S. degree in the Data Science group under the Communication Engineering Dept. at NTU. My area of focus centers around research and programming, with a particular interest in Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision (CV). I have a particular interest in Computer Vision (CV) and strive to enhance my understanding and insight in this field by immersing myself in trending papers. 
<!-- Besides, one of my notable strengths lies in my exceptional problem-solving skills. I possess an unwavering eagerness to learn and adapt to new technologies and tools, always striving to meet the demands of each project I undertake. -->

Currently, I’m advised by [Yu‑Chiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/ycwang.html) at [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/). My research primarily revolves around various CV domains, including but not limited to **Federated Learning**, **Referring Video Object Segmentation**, 3D generation, Self-supervised Learning, Transfer Learning, Vision & Language, etc. Through my dedication and continuous exploration, I aim to contribute to the advancement of Computer Vision while expanding my knowledge and expertise in this exciting field.
